    Fixes indentation by converting each change in indentation in the code to pep8 standard of 4 spaces. Works out what
    is a postive or negative indentation by comparing the indentation to the previous line (but ignoring blank lines
    to preserve any separation the user has added).
    :param _code: List containing each line of the input code.
    :return: List containing each line of the resultant code (with correct indents)
