# Pretty Python

## Overview
I started this project after receiving a few assignments from my college involving some skeleton code. The skeleton code provided was quite badly formatted, and so I started writing some code to make it "pretty" (pep8 compliant). 

This made it much easier to navigate, understand and complete the assignments.

Currently, 3 features are implemented, but I plan to return to this project to allow the module to complete finer code optimisations, such as refactoring variable names and more.

## Running
### Dependencies
All modules used in this package are part of the standard python distribution.

### Running preconfigured formatter
To start the program:
```
 .../pretty_python/ $ python3 -m pretty_python.main 
```

### Running program manually
To start the python interpreter:
```
 .../pretty_python/ $ python3
```

To load the functions and classes required:
```
>>> from pretty_python import *
```
